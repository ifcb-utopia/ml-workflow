## About
This repo contains code and jupyter notebooks used to train CNN models using labeled IFCB images. To date, all work for this repository has been completed on Microsoft Azure virtual machine (cloud computing resources). IFCB images accessed by the notebooks for model training are also uploaded to the virtual machine to increase the speed of model training.
